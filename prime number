Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself

num = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
           print("Not a prime number")
           break
    else:
        print("Is a prime number")
else:
    print("Not a prime number")
